            <p>Every year in January I put up a survey on my blog asking what 
                you’d all love to see more of on Sunny Side Up and guess what 
                the number one thing is that I always hear back?  A regular day!  
                Never what I’m expecting to hear, but I get it!  It’s always fun 
                to see how other people live and how they fit in all that they do. 
                 So friends, this is it.  Today I’m sharing what a typical day in my 
                 life looks like.  You can bet it will be beyond glamourous. ;)  I’m 
                 joining my friends Amy and Christy at Magnolia Lane and a group of 
                 fun bloggers in this series so there will be lots of fun “day in the l
                 ife” posts to check out!  It’s always the best to get ideas and learn 
                 from each other.
    
                I picked a day last week and documented the whole thing from start to finish.
                  I used my cell phone for a lot of the pics during all times of the day (not 
                  just good lighting times) so this truly is real life in all of it’s grainy 
                  glory. Grab a snack!  My days are long. ;)  Here we go!
